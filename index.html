  <p>A woman is walking home with her 3 daughters.</p>

<p>The eldest daughter turns to her and asks, "Mummy, how did I get my name?"</p>

<p>"Well sweetie, when we were bringing you home from the hospital, a rose petal landed on your head! So that's why we named you Rose.‚Äù</p>

<p>The second daughter, now curious, asks the same question.</p>

<p>"Well darling, when we were bringing you home from the hospital, a lily petal landed on your head! So that's why we named you Lily."</p>

<p>The third girl asks "HHGHGNGHGHNG?!?!?! DDDNBHGHBHNGHHH!!!"</p>

<p>"Shut up, brick!"</p>
